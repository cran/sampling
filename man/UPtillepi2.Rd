\title{Joint inclusion probabilties for Tille sampling}
\description{
Computes the joint (second-order) inclusion probabilities for Tillé sampling.
}
\usage{
UPtillepi2(pik,eps=1e-6)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{vector of the first-order inclusion probabilities.}
\item{eps}{control value, by default equal to 1e-6.}
}
\value{
Returns a NxN matrix of the following form: the main diagonal contains the first-order inclusion 
probabilities for each unit k in the population; elements (k,l) are the joint inclusion
probabilities of units k and l, with k not equal to l. N is the population size. The value \code{eps} is used to
control \code{pik} (pik>eps & pik < 1-eps).
