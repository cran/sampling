\title{Sampford sampling}
\description{
Uses the Sampford's method to select a sample of units (unequal probabilities, without replacement, fixed sample size).
}
\usage{
UPsampford(pik,eps=1e-6, max_iter=500)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{vector of the inclusion probabilities.}
\item{eps}{control value, by default equal to 1e-6.}
\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations in the algorithm.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector (with elements 0 and 1) of size N, the population size.  
Each element k of this vector indicates the status of unit k 
(1, unit k is selected in the sample; 0, otherwise).
The value eps is used to control pik (pik>eps & pik < 1-eps). 
The sample size must be small with respect to the 
population size; otherwise, the selection time can be very long.
