\title{Joint inclusion probabilities for Sampford sampling}
\description{
Computes the joint (second-order) inclusion probabilities for Sampford sampling.
}
\usage{
UPsampfordpi2(pik)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{vector of the first-order inclusion probabilities.}
}
\value{
Returns a NxN matrix of the following form: the main diagonal contains the first-order inclusion 
probabilities for each unit k in the population; elements (k,l) are the joint inclusion
probabilities of units k and l, with k not equal to l. N is the population size.
