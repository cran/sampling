\title{Midzuno sampling}
\description{
Uses the Midzuno's method to select a sample of units (unequal probabilities, without replacement, fixed sample size).
}
\usage{
UPmidzuno(pik,eps=1e-6)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{vector of the inclusion probabilities.}
\item{eps}{control value, by default equal to 1e-6.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector (with elements 0 and 1) of size N, the population size. 
Each element k of this vector indicates the status of unit k 
(1, unit k is selected in the sample; 0, otherwise). The value 'eps' is used to
control pik (pik>eps & pik < 1-eps).
